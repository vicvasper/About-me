# 👋 Hi, I’m @vicvasper!

- 👀 I’m passionate about creating all kinds of game mechanics, from simple to complex, for both **AAA** and **indie** games.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and experimenting with new mechanics to enhance gameplay experiences.
- 💼 My focus is on developing versatile systems that can adapt to different game styles and genres.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where innovative mechanics take center stage.

## 🚀 Projects

- **[Optimized Grass System - UE5.3](https://github.com/vicvasper/Optimized-Grass-System-UE5.3)**:  
  An optimized grass terrain generator that creates grass blades within a terrain tile. It features customizable parameters such as width, height, density, spacing, and tile size, allowing for dynamic terrain generation.

- **[Side Camera System - UE5.3](https://github.com/vicvasper/Side-Camera-System-UE5.3)**:  
  An adaptive side camera system inspired by *Little Nightmares*. Instead of following the player directly, it uses strategically placed pivot points and transitions smoothly between them. The system adjusts the camera angle, maintaining focus on the player without losing sight.

- **[Physics Interactive Cube - UE5.3](https://github.com/vicvasper/Physics-Interactive-Cube-UE5.3)**:  
  A physics-based system where you can rotate a cube by clicking and dragging with the mouse, allowing for interactive manipulation of the object.
